    <h2>Hi, I'm Tomas</h2>
    <p>I write software and solve problems. I learn unrelentingly, and I pursue excellence with resilience and passion.
        If you'd like, you can <a href="/about">read more about me.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I intend for this blog to generally be about my technological foibles and adventures with learning things in the
        Linux ecosystem while using non-Microsoft tools. I don't expect to post very often, as I'm not the best at
        writing about myself, but I do enjoy sharing knowledge, so hopefully that will motivate me to post more often
        than never. Feel free to click around above
