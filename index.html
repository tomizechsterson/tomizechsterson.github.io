    <h2>Hi, I'm Tomas</h2>
    <p>I write software and solve problems. I learn unrelentingly, and I pursue excellence with resilience and passion.
        If you'd like, you can <a href="/about">read more about me.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I intend for this blog to generally be about my technological foibles and adventures with learning things in the
        Linux ecosystem while using non-Microsoft tools. I do enjoy sharing knowledge, and I find myself tinkering with
        quite a few different side projects at various times, so hopefully that will give me enough material to post
        more often than never. Feel free to click around above.
